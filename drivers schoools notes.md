# Unit 3 - Getting Started
before you get into a car you should check for flat tires, leaks, animals, objects and people
walk around the outside of the vehicle and check for the three P's
Pedestrians,Pets,Property 
kids at 1 are most likely to be injured in backover incidents 
coolant is green,white orange or pink in color it also feels sticky 
fuel is colorless and thin. but it'll smell like a gas station 
oil is black or brown depending on its age. If your oil pressure is on then you just shouldn't drive your car
transmission fluid is red or brown depending on its age. 
## Getting started lock the doors
You should lock your doors to not get robbed 🤯
also you should lock your doors to be more safe during a crash
## Getting started: Adjusting head restraints 
### Where does the head restraint go
* Top of the head restraint should be even with the top of the head aor as high as it will go 
* Distance from the back of the head to the restraint should be as small as possible 
## Getting started adjusting your seat for safety
* No lounging 
* make sure your feet can reach the pedals
* make sure you can reach the steering wheel without moving your arms too much
## Getting started: Hand position on the Wheel
* 9 and 3 are considered the best place to have your hands for the best control and least injury from air bags
* 8 and 4 is considered by some to be better at maintaining control and avoiding injury from airbags
## Getting Started: Adjusting Mirrors for Safety
Rear View mirror
* it should be facing directly behind the vehicle
* should allow a driver to see the entire rear view window
* you should check your rear view mirror several times a minute
* Some research says a drivers should check mirrors every five seconds
* you MUST check your rear view before changing lanes, slowing down, entering traffic from the side of a street, driving down a long, steep hill, or when at a stop light 
## Back up Cameras 
* They minimize blind spots and avoid back over incidents 
* may be used on the skills test at the MVA
* Cameras do not relace head checks
* any car modelled after 2018 has a backup camera 
## Adjusting side mirrors 
### Enhanced mirror settings when used correctly
* limit the need to complete numerous head checks
* DO NOT ELIMINATE THE NEED TO CONDUCT A HEAD CHECK
* allow the area in the front of the car to stay in the peripheral view when a driver does have to check side mirrors
* night time glare removed
you can be removed from the MVA test if you dont move your head
### for the drivers side mirror 
adjust until you cannot see your car and the lane to the right of you 
### for the passenger side mirror
I missed the rest of it but like make sure you can see the two lanes beside you 
### to see if your mirros are in the right place
## seat belts, air bags, and car seats
PEople in maryland cannot drive so there are a whole lot of car accidents
* place lap belt snugly across hips
* adjust center post mounting for height if vehicle is so equipped
* belt over top of should and across center of chest to distribute force in the event of a crash
* keep seat back in upright position to avoid sliding out of the seat in a frontal crash
* under 8 years old must be secured in a child safety seat unless the child is 4'9"
* kids under 12 should be in the back seat 
* you can get the fire station to install your car seats 
## The law
* everyone must wear a seatbelt
* not wearing seatbelts are both a primary and secondary violation depending on the seat
* the current penalty for not wearing a safety belt is a ticket (as of 2024 83$ per unbelted person)
## Air bags
* They protect against head and chest injuries
* they work with safety belts, they dont replace them
* you should adjust your seat for a minimum of 10 inches of clearance between chest and steering wheel 
## Vehicle control equipment 
Things like steering,breaking,gears stuff like that you get the point
## Steering wheel
Direct the vehicle
Maintain control of the vehicle
Newer vehicles allow the driver to control Bluetooth gps radio settings and more 
## Break and Accelerator
### accelerator pedal 
* Located on the right corner of the driver side floor
* allows the driver to control speed by the amount of pressure applied by the right foot to the accelerator
### brake pedal
*located to the left to the accelerator
* allows driver to stop vehicle
* stopping distance is determined by the amount of pressure driver applies and the amount of friction on the road 
## Parking brake
* Designed to hold a vehicle in place when it is parked
* it can either be a pedal at the far left side or a lever on the console
### my parents call the parking brake the emergency brake why?
* it can be used to help slow the vehicle if the hydraulic or ABS brakes fail 
## Shift lever
* park locks your transmission you cannot move in park. you cannot take out your key until you're in park
* Reverse is used to back up
* (N) Neutral allows your wheels to roll without engine power 
* Drive keeps the vehicle moving forward 
* 2 OR 1 OR D1 OR D2 is used for towing something or in inclement weather 
## Cruise control
* Cruise control is only used on highways
* allows driver to maintain speed without having to hold down the accelerator
* should not be used in heavy traffic, or on wet, slippery roads 
* each vehicle has slightly different cruise control features 
## Vehicle Communication Devices
* Horn
* headlights
* turn signals
* Hazard flashers
* Windsheidl wipers
## Vehicle comfort devices 
* Radios 
* Heat and AC
* Seat warmers and coolers 
* Sun visor
## Instrument panel: how your car communicates with you
* The thing that measures your RPM is your Tachometer
* on the gas take theres going to be an arrow to tell you where the uhhh thing you put the gas in is 
* the thing with the thermometer is the temperature gauge. Its good until it isn't
* Green or blue lights indicate a system is being used currently 
* yellow or orange lights indicate a situation you need to address but may not be urgent 
* The thing that looks like a soup bowl with an exclamation mark is for tire pressure
* Red lights are bad you dont want to see these
* Flashing red is and extremely dangerous malfunction
* ((!)) means the brakes are failing
* the dripping thing is the oil pressure being too high
* The battery means your electrical system is failing 


# Unit 4 - Moving The Car

## Starting Your Vehicle

* Foot on the brake pedal
* parking brake disengaged
* Gear selector in park
* Turn the key to the right to the start (or push the start button)
* Check gauges

## Starting your Vehicle The brake

* your right foot should be on the brake 
* the left foot should be on the thing on the left 
* Many cars will not start if your foot is not on the brake 
* What about parking brakes?

## Starting Your Vehicle

* The ACC setting allows a driver to turn on vehicle accessories like the fan and the radio. Leaving it on for an extensive period of time drains the battery
* Start and on: Turn the key all the way until you hear the motor turn on. The switch will automatically go back to the on position

## Keyless Starters  

* To start the engine make sure you have your smart key inside the vehicle and the shifter is in park
* Hold the brake pedal down while you press the engine start/stop button
* To turn the engine off put it in park then press the engine start/stop button

## Should I let my car idle

* During warmer months you do not need to idle the vehicle at all
* during colder months only 30-60 seconds is recommended
* Check the owners manual for more information 

* long idling periods reduces gas efficiency waste fuel, and increase harmful vehicle emmissions 
* It is illegal to leave your car running and unattended 

## Check all your Gagues - review

* Any red indicators means you shouldnt go at all
* yellow is just a warning
* check your guages to see if theres anything in the red 


## What next?

* S.E.E The key to good driving decisions
* Search.Evaluate.Execute

## Why Do you need to SEE: risk
* Risk is the chance that something bad can happen 

## What types of risks are there?

* Animals, Pedestrians, Passangers and Distraction 
* 1 passenger is +50% risk
* 2 passengers is +300% risk
* 4+ passengers is +400% risk

## What Is SEE

* Search (Visual Skill)
* Evaluate (Thinking Skill)
* Execute (Motor Skills)

## Search A Visual Task

* Aim high
    * If a driver is going 35mph, how far ahead should a driver look?
    * If a driver is going 55mph how far ahead should a driver look?
    The answer is as far as you can see. they have a set number but nobody cares to remember
    * Distractions impact your search
    * The time of day (or more of the time of night) impacts your search
    * Bad Weather impacts your search 

* The road can change in the time it takes a car door to open

## Evaluate: Think twice Drive once

* What actions can a driver safely take
    * What possible risks immediately in front of you that you may or may not see
    * what are the possible risks are behind you 
    * what possible risks are 3-5 seconds in front of us and what is 10-15 seconds in front of us

## What is in front of you
* You should be 3-5 seconds behind them during the day in good weather 
* In dangerous conditions increase the following distance 

## Where can you go safely
* When do you need to know what is behind your vehicle 
    * Changing lanes 
    * reducing speed
    * preparing to enter a driveway or a side street
    * preparing to enter a parking space

## Do you have enough space

* Center position is where a driver should be when going forward with no intention to turn
* right side should be if you're preparing for a right turn
* left side is the same as right side with the added bonus of giving cyclists more room 

## What is under you 

* Types of the road, direction, weather conditions, lanes can affect your evaluation.

## What is off the road
Evaluate the curbs and the shoulders

## Execute Hand to Hand Steering

* Hands are balanced at 9-3 position or 8-4 
* control from both hands
* The method to steer when driving straight down the road 

## Push pull steering

* Used to turn your vehicle to acoid problems
* as one hand pulls the other hand pushes
* To return to driving straight allow the wheel to slide back to the center

## Communicate with other drivers

* When changing lanes or moving into traffic, signal. 
* Signals
    * Turning
        * Turn signals on when preparing to turn 
        * Remember to turn it off if necessary
    * Backing
        * Revrse light usually come on automatically when a car is in reverse.
        * Provide extra warning to drivers behind you.

    * Hazard
        * Should only be used when on the side of teh road and disabled in emergency situations

    * Horn
        * Should only be used in emergencies 

## Moving Forward

* Do not take your foot off the brake unless if you're ready to drive 

## Braking

* Pivot your foot from the gas pedal to the brake pedal
* Slowly and gently press down on the brake
* Pretend there is an egg under the pedal you don't want to break.

## Backing up

* Backing is an extermely Risky driving task
* There is limited visibility and possibly changing road conditions

* Steps to back correctly
    * Go slowly; should not have foot on accelerator
    * should be lightly resting on brake to control vehicle speed
    * Check all mirrors before backing and keep checking as you mvoe back
    * Limit the distance you will back up whenever possible
    * Turn the wheel in the direction you want the rear of the car to go 

* Remember to use your backup Cameras if available but continue to conduct head checks and use your mirrors

>>> Fun to do with your friends in your car
>>> I think its fun
>>> going 80 85
>>> I think im a good driver :Skull:
>>> I love to blast my music in my car
>>> I do text and drive

    * Children may be walking in the street and not on the sidewalk
    * Children may be playing near bus stops
    * Children may be arriving late for the bus and crossing the street without looking 

## School busses: Safe and Legal Driving

* Yellow flashing lights
    * Bus is preparing to stop to load or unload children
    * Drivers should be slowing down and preparing to stop 

* Red flashing lights and extended stop arms
    * The bus has stopped
    * Drivers must stop at least 20 feet in back or 20 feet in front if there is no divider between vehicles and bus.
   Failing to stop may get a driver a 3 point citation and a fine of at least $250 

## School Zones: What are the risks

* Distracted children
* Distracted parents 

## School Zones: Safe and legal driving

* Speed limits are usually lowered when school is in session
* Usually theres cameras
* Drivers must yield to pedestrians in the school crosswalk and follow the directions of any crossing guard 

## Bicycles: Risks

* New bike riders who may not be as steady or stable
* Riders who may be playing in the street and not paying attention 

* Slow down and wiat for bikes to pass on turns
* on straight paths bikes have the right of way
* check blind spots for bikes
* Must yield to bicyclists riding in bike lanes and shoulders when entering or crossing occupied bike lanes and shoulders
* Must yield to a bicyclists operating lawfully in a crosswalk

* cyclists have to follow all traffic laws
* They also have hand signals. Remember that video that was like turn signals for women 💀

* if you get into an argument pray you have health insurance cause you're getting shot also bikers fault 

## Pedestrians: Safe and Legal Driving 

* More than 3000 pedestrian crashes annually
* More than 80% of crashes involve serious injury or a fatality
* Most pedestrain related crashes occur in urban areas and most frequently occur between 3:00 in the afternoon and 10:00 at night
* new drivers are more likely to get into a crash

* You must come to a complete stop when a pedestrian is in the crosswalk
* You must not pass a vehicle that is stopped to allow a pedestrian to cross 
* When turning right or left you must yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk 

## Driving in neightborhoods what will you do?

* Enter and exit a driveway
* Make a right turn at a stop sign
* Make a left turn at a stop sign 
* Pull into traffic from the side of the road
* Speed bumps and potholes 
* Roundabouts
* parking lots

## Where to stop if there is no line

* Stop at the stop sign 🤯
* Do a staggerd stop

## Making a right turn with a stop sign: Evaluate

* HAVe you come to a complete and total stop?
* HAve you searched in all directions
* What are some other factors you need to evaluate
    * The Speed and traffic patterns of those around you
    * Time of Day
    * Road conditions

## Making a right turn with a stop sign: Execute

* Begin to signal your intention to turn at least 100 feet before your turn.
* Start the process of searching and evaluating.
    * Remember the risks of neighborhood driving
    * Check your mirrors
* as you approach the crosswalk brake and slow down

## Driving in neighborhoods making a left turn

* Left turns are much more dangerous than any other type of turn
* When you turn left you are crossign another road users lane of travel putting yourself at greater risk
* A door and an airbag may be the only thing keeping you safe 

## Making a left turn: Execute

* Signal at least 100 feet from the intersection
* Check your mirros and your blind spot
* Check for potential hazards
* Turn your head in the direction of the turn before turning the sterring wheel
* Straighten the car gradually accelerate to the proper speed and check your mirrors 
* A driver will need to check traffic in all directions to check if its completely safe

## What do you do in a roundabout

* You move up to the yield line and wait for a gap in traffic
* Reduce your speed and keep to the right
* Watch for bicyclists and pedestrains
* You do not have to stop in the roundabout you have the right of way over entering traffic
* Always keep to the right of the central island and travel in a counter clockwise direction
* use your signal appropriately when entering and exiting 

## driving in neighborhoods backing out of driveways

* constantly check on whats behind you

## Potholes how to drive around them safely

* Potholes form in bad weather when water seeps into pavement
* As a driver you need to
    * Look ahead: Make a point of checking the road ahead for potholes
    * slowdown reduce speed safely
    * beware of puddles they can disguise a deep pothole 

## Speed humps

* Designed to control speed in  areas where there may not be many traffic control devices
* Will need to lower speed many warning signs have a recommended speed posted.
* failing to do so may result in serious damage to your vehicle 

## Reference points

* What are reference points
    * points on a vehicle allowing a driver to estimate location with respect to a fixed point like a curb or a stop line

    * When your mirror lines up with te stop line then you are at the correct distance from the stop line

    * When the driver can see the middle of the vehicle hood lined up with the curb then the vehicle is about 6 feet away from the car

## Perpendicular parking

* Check traffic to the rear and signal appropriately
* position as far left as possible 
* When front bumper passes left tail light of parked car turn sharply to right
* Straighten wheels when centered into space using forward reference point
* Do not accellerate when parking

## Angel parking

* Check for traffic and pedestrains
* Signal on approach
* Position 6 feet from row of parked cars

## Leaving an angled parking space

* Check in all directions
* Continuously check mirros and back up cameras do head checks as well
* Move straight back until the back of the front seat is in line with teh rear of the vehicle on the side of the turn
* Shadow the brake for quick stops if needed 

## Turning Around: To the right side

* Check traffic to the rear and SEE
* Signal right and begin slowing as you proceed past the driveway
* Stop 3-4 feet away from the curb

## Driving Test Tip: Reverse Two-point turnabout

* Will drive past an area representing a driveway or alley
* Will be required to back your vehicle into the designated area until the front of your vehicle clears the front set of cones
* You have to use your turn signal still 
* You have 3 minutes to complete the Reverse Two point Turnabout
* Will then be asked to exit the area to the right

## What is the MVA testing

* your backing skills
* Visual skills 
* Judgement of space
* use of mirrors and turn signals
* Steering
* braking
* acceleration control 
* general driving skills 

## Turning around left side

* before beginning turn be sure to see
* make sure there is an adequate gap in traffic
* signal your intention to turn

# Unit 6 Driving faster with more risk:
Suburban, Urban, and rural Driving 

## Urban Roads: Narrow, Congested Roads

What are the risks of narrow congested roads
* Parked cars
* people crossing the street without looking carfully
* little space

## Risk factors on urban roads

* Mixed use roads why are they risky?
    * People coming adn going to work
    * people coming and going home
    * People coming and going to shop
    * children coming and going to school
    * PEople doing the unexpected all the time 


## Pedestrians: The law

* A driver must yield to hearing, sight, or mobility impaired pedestrians in the crosswalk
* Pedestrains have the right-of-way at street crossings 
* They must obey traffic signals

## Why search is so important

* When hitting a pedestrian at 20mph only 9/10 of them survive
* If a pedestrian is hit at 30mph only 5/10 survive
* If a pedestrian is hit at 40mph only 1/10 survive

## Emergency and Service Vehicles 

* Tow trucks and service vehicles
* and you know the obvious ones the cops and the doctors

## Emergency vehicles and the law

* Emergency vehicles always have the right of way when using lights or sirens
* When an emergency vehicle is approaching from behind, a driver must move as close as possible to the edge of the road and stop until it passes
* If you are going in the same direction as the emergency vehicle, you may not pass it unless it stops or you are directed to do so by law enforcement
* If an emergency vehicle is pulled over to the side of the road you must move over one lane or slow down to a safe speed 

## Urban Driving Alleys

* Alleys create additional entry points onto roads
* Vehicles may unexpectedly appear to merge onto a main road
* Drivers should expect the unexpected 

## When in traffic

* Traffic is part of urban driving
* Stay Calm
* Pay attention 
* stay focused
* Do not honk your horn
* Do not crash out 💀

## One way Streets

* One way streets are frequently foudn in urban areas
* Indicated by a black and white regulatory sign that shows the direction of traffic flow
* May also have a red Do not enter sign or Wrong way Sign

## Intersections: Why are they risky

* intersections - multiple conflict points
    * Places where vehicles pedestrians and other road users may all be at teh same time
    * Conflict points pose the greatest risk for crashes
    * High number of conflict points make it challenging for a driver to effectively search and evaluate all possible paths of travel
    * High number of conflicting poitns make it likely that the road may change quickly and frequently 

## Intersections Search

In cities you have to look ahead in case there are parked vehicles and you really dont want to be stopped behind those 

## Intersections Execute

* Select the best lane of traffic
* Signal if necessary
* Continuously search and evaluate the safety of your course of action
* Yield to pedestrians
* Allow for appropriate space

## Intersections making a right turn on red

* Search extremely carfully
* Evaluate carefully all possible actions
* Check for any signs
* Need to stop and search again ebfore making turn
* you DO NOT have to make a turn on red. people wont like you if you dont though.
* Also I think its like illegal in DC and NYC. Idk I just heard it somewhere

## Making left turns

* Check for any signs restricting left turns
* Reduce speed
* Continue to search
* Begin your turn when you front wheels are at the center of the intersection

## Shared left turn lanes

* What two things can be done in a shared left turn lane?
* Turn left from a highway
* Turn left onto a highway

## Urban Roads Parallel parking 

* Search
    * What is beside you and what is behind you
    * Check for other road users
    * Remember to check your mirrors
    * Remember a head check
* Evaluate
    * Do you have enough room
* Execute
    * Position your vehicle next to the car in front of your spot 
    * check mirros continously throughout process
    * Shift to reverse and search again
    * Turn steering wheel to the right
    * Look over right shoulder and back slowly
    * When your back left bumper is alligned with the middle of the car behind you turn the wheel in proper direction
    * Continue to back up slowly straightenening steering wheel
    * When both the front and back of your vehicle aligns with the vehicles in front of and in back of you, you are in the spot

## parallel parking: Mistakes

* Failing to signal
* Not getting close enough (or too close) to the vehicle in front of you
* Hitting the curb as you are backing up.
* Hitting the car in front of or in back of yours
* Failing to check mirrors
* Failing to signal when entering or exiting spot

## What is a Suburban Road?

* Suburban roads
    * Large roads, usually 3 or 4 lanes going in each direction
    * Speed limits are usually between 30-55 mph
    * May connect mslaler developments to larger more populated areas
    * Have many entrance and exit points
    * Have larger and more complicated intersections
    * May also have significant congestion

## Suburban risks

* Variety of road users
* Traffic and congestion
* Roads are larger and higher speed than in urban areas
* Intersections are more complicated 
* Many entry and exit points along road

## Tasks on Suburban roads: Yielding

* What is a yield?
    * It doesnt mean to stop 100% of the time
    * It means to slow down and prepare to allow another driver to go in front of you
    * You may also have to stop to let another vehicle in front of you
    * There are laws for determining who must yield for another vehicle


## Yielding Who has the right of way

* You should be prepared to yield:
    * To a driver is at or arrives before you at the intersection
    * To a driver in the opposint graffic lane if you are making a left turn
    * To a driver on your right if both of you arrive at the intersection at the same time 
    * To a driver on ap ublic road if you are entering the highway from a driveway on a private road

## Risks of Rural roads

* Trains
* Animals
* Curved roads with limited visibility
* Limited shoulder areas
* Higher speeds with no barriers

## Trains
* Most dangerous crossing without warning lights or gates
* Tarins can take 1-3 miles to stop
* Look and listen for trains when approaching tracks
* Never go under or around railroad gates
* Never stop on railroad tracks
* Be especially alert after dark 

## Deer 
* Usually see them at dawn and dusk
* Peak deer season is from October to January 
* Most frequently found on the outskirts of town and in heavily wooded areas
* Deer almost never travel alone. If you see one deer others are neer 

## How to avoid a crash with a deer

* slow down especially at dawn or dusk
* Look for the shine of eyes along the roadside
* Use your high beams whenever the road is free of oncoming traffic
* Deer can become mesmerized by steady, bright lights. If you see one on the road, slow down and flash your lights
* Pay close attention to warning signs including deer
* If you are on a multi lane road, drive in the center to give as much aspace to grazing deer as possible 
> I hate how those guys just get up after they get hit. YOU SHOULD BE DEAD

## Encountering a Deer

* never swerve to avoid a deer
* Dont rely on any gedgets to scare off deer
* call 911 if injured. Even for the deer because they block the road 
* Never touch an animal that is in the roadway
* Repoard the incident to your insurance company 

## Pass With Care

* Search
    * What is aroudn you in all directions
* Evaluate
    * Estimate the space and time needed to pass
    * Position yourself two to three seconds behind the vehicle you want to pass
    * Check your mirrors and oncoming traffic.
    * Check ahead for safe passing distance 
    * Signal your intentions

## Passing: Execute

* Signal your intention and accelerate into passing lane
* Accelerate quickly to an appropriately do not exceed teh posted speed limit
* Concentrate on the path ahead.
* Check your mirrors for following cars

* Check your Rear-view mirror for the front of the car you are passing
* Signal your intentions 
* change lanes maintaining speed
* Cancel turn signal 

# Unit 7 Driving off into the sunset

Highways, Expressways and Interstates 

## What is an expressway 
* Limited points to enter and exit (Controlled access)
* Usually have a minimum and maximum speed limit 
* Divided by medians or barricades 
* Multiple lanes heading in both directions
* only motorized vehicles
* May have bridges tunnles and toll plazas 

## SEE Entrance Ramp and Acceleration Lane 
* Be sure to consistently search for what is in front of you, what is behind you and what is next to you
* remember to use all of your mirrors 
* Complete Head check to make sure no on is in your blind spot
* Be prepared to adjust speed to merge smoothly
* Remember that traffic on the road has right of way 

## Driving on an Expressway Safe and legal distance
* Maintain 3-4 seconds following distance
* Increase following distance behind large trucks in bad weather and when driving a heavy vehicle pulling trailer
* If you are being tailgated by another driver move to the right to encourage the driver to pass you

## Driving on the Interstate: Its still driving 
* Interstate
    * Search continously to look for changing conditions
    * Follow all posted signs
    * signal when you want to change lanes
    * Keep your electronics put away and keep your seatbelt on 
* Non-interstate
    * Search continously to look for changing conditions
    * Follow all posted signs
    * signal when you want to change lanes
    * Keep your electronics put away and keep your seatbelt on 

## What might a driver encounter on an expressway
* Cars and trucks
* Motocycles
* law enforcement
* large commercial trucks and bussess
* Tunnels
* Bridges
* toll plazas
* Construction zones
* traffic 😊 I love maryland

## Motocycles: The risks
* Smaller than many other vehicles and may get lost in a vehicles blind spot
* Brake lights on a motocycle may not always light to indicate slowing or stopping 
* may swerve to avoid pot holes and other hazards

## Motocycles The laws for drivers 
* Look twice before changing lanes
* Do not share a lane - do not let a Motorcycle be in the same lane with you (not like vertically in the same lane but like horizontally in the same lane)
* Do not tailgate or drive too closely
* Allow plenty of space between your vehicle and a motorcycle when passing
* Be careful around groups of motorcyles 

## Emergency Vehicles The Risks
Every year first responders are seriously injured or killed on the side of the road while doing their job 
* When traffic is moving and the emergency or service vehicle is on the shoulder with the lights flashing
    * A driver MUST move over one lane if safe and possible
    * If a driver cannot change lanes safely, then they MUST drop their speed by at least 10mph

## Risks: Construction Zones
* workers very close to fast moving traffic
* Unexpected road changes
* Shoulder areas msmaller or nonexistent 
* Photo enforced speed limit

## Construction Zones Safe and Legal Driving
* Always obey speed limit
* Maintain focus as the road or traffic conditions may change unexpectedly
* Watch for motorcycles that may have to adjust to avoid rough or uneven roads

## Commercial Vehicles: Large and heavy
* How large? Usually weigh at least 26001 pounds and can weight as much as 80,000 pounds
* Can transport 16 or more passengers
* Can be used to transport all types of materials including hazardous ones 

## Commercial Vehicles: Risks
* Additional Weight
    * Commercial vehicles can weight more than 80k pounds
    * Additional weight increases stopping distance
* Additional Height
    * Creates blind spots for truck drivers who may not see you and other vheicles around them
    * Makes maneuvering to avoid crashes much more difficult

## Comercial Vehicles: Safe and legal driving
* Be aware of no zones and do not drive in them for a long tim
* In this area they cannot see a average sized vehicle
* At 55mph with optimal conditions a truck will take at least 325 feet to stop 

## Tunnels: Risks 
* Crowded
* Narrow
* Dark
* No shoulders

## Tunnels: Safe And Legal Driving
